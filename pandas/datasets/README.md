# Datasets Folder

This folder contains **sample datasets** used for practicing and demonstrating **Pandas DataFrame operations**.

The datasets are a mix of:
- **Self-created small datasets**, and
- **Reference datasets copied from educational YouTube sources** for learning purposes.

All data is used strictly for **practice and understanding**, not for production or commercial use.

---

## 📂 Folder Contents

Datasets are available in multiple formats:

- **CSV (`.csv`)** – Tabular data practice  
- **JSON (`.json`)** – Structured / nested data practice  
- **Excel (`.xlsx`)** – Spreadsheet-style data handling  

Some files are recreated manually, while others are **directly taken or adapted from tutorials**.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of These Datasets

- Practice reading data into Pandas DataFrames
- Learn file handling with different formats
- Reproduce examples shown in tutorials
- Understand real-world data layouts used in teaching

This folder is **learning-focused**, not a showcase of original datasets.

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- These datasets are **not original research data**
- File sizes are intentionally small
- Data may be overwritten during practice
- Folder paths are used directly in code examples
